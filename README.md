# Richard's Portfolio site

## Currently under construction
---------------

## Description
---------------
This is a personal portfolio site where my projects, skills and experiences will be for people to have a look at.

## Features
--------------
This site uses Next.js to statically render the page for immediate interaction.

The site also features an admin page where I can update my skills, projects and experiences without having to redeploy the site. It utilises a Firebase Firestore to store all the data.
